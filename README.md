# THE BODY-MASS INDEX CALCULATOR

![Am I responsive](https://github.com/jpsantostefano/body-mass-index-calculator/blob/main/docs/features/bmic-aimresponsive.png?raw=true)

This application provides a simple and efficient tool to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI). By entering weight and height, the program calculates the BMI and classifies the user into one of the standard categories (for example, underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese). After obtaining the result, the user has the option to save this information to track it over time, making it easier to monitor changes in BMI and promote a healthy lifestyle.

- The user has to input one of the three options. The options are "Calculate the body-mass index", "see your history" or "exit". 

![Select option](https://github.com/jpsantostefano/body-mass-index-calculator/blob/main/docs/features/main-menu.jpg)

- If the user input an invalid option, it will show a message saying "Please, insert a valid option". The valid options are 1, 2, or 3.

![Invalid option](https://github.com/jpsantostefano/body-mass-index-calculator/blob/main/docs/features/invalid-mainmenu.jpg)

#### **Option 1**: *Calculate body-mass index*

- When the user select the first option, the program will ask for their weight and their height.

![Weight and height](https://github.com/jpsantostefano/body-mass-index-calculator/blob/main/docs/features/height.jpg)

- If the user input an invalid value, a message will show saying "Please, insert a right value"

![Invalid value](https://github.com/jpsantostefano/body-mass-index-calculator/blob/main/docs/features/invalid-calculator.jpg)

- After inserting the two values, the program will calculate the body-mass index "(weight/(height/100)" and show a message saying the index and the category which the user is in.
- At the same time, it will show a message asking if the user wants to save this record on a spread sheet table linked with the program. It will save the actual date and the body-mass index.

### Features Left to Implement

In the future, I would like to:

- To add a spreadsheet in which the user enters the meals eaten during the day and automatically calculates and showing the total of calories and proteins ingested.

- To include educational information about the importance of BMI and tips for maintaining a healthy weight.

- To add colours and more ASCII art and formatting to the program.
